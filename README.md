# MyMainAchievement

=========
Hello! Welcome to my Github!

My name is Beidan(Sophia), I am currently a master of Finance student at UCSD, but I've made up my mind to study for another master's degree for comuputer science. I know it seems a bit impetus, but I just love computer programming so much that I couldn't let it go.

Starting from nothing, I can now proficiently use Java and Python to build APIs and UIs to do web crawling, information extracting, web development, data analysis & machine learning. But, my education background is not technical at all, I've spent my every second in building up my skills to strength my resume.

Knowing how I am crazy about computer science and how valuable the opportunities for me, I am going to exert all my efforts into it, either study or jobs.

If you are interested in me, please contact me at huangbeidan@gmail.com.
