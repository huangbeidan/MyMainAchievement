Those capable of accessing the WWW might prefer to use the WWW interface available via http:\/\/pgp.mit.edu\/ This service exists only to help transfer keys between PGP users. It does NOT attempt to guarantee that a key is a valid key; use the signatures on a key for that kind of security. Valid commands are: Command Result ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------- INDEX userid List all PGP keys containing the words in userid VERBOSE INDEX userid Verbose list of all keys containing userid GET userid Get the key(s) matching userid ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Each keyserver processes requests in the form of mail messages.

If you *REALLY* need the whole index file or key ring, *PLEASE* contact the administrator of a keyserver and ask them for a dump. NOTE: PGP is extremely slow when operating on large keyrings. Adding the full ring of the keyserver to your own ring will take several *MONTHS* to complete.\n"}]}

So, why would anyone take parenting advice from me? I\u2019ve spent the last 11 years leading one of the world\u2019s largest young adult ministries, and it has given me a unique view into the results of other parents\u2019 parenting. I have interacted with tens of thousands of twentysomethings who are fresh out of the nest, and I\u2019ve seen the impact various parenting styles make on young adults. I\u2019ve closely observed some extraordinary kids and sibling groups and have had the privilege of learning from their parents\u2019 examples. As a result, I believe the following to be true:\nExtraordinary young adults often come from extraordinary parents.\nExtraordinary parents often share common practices.\nBelow is a list of ten habits of extraordinary parents. My prayer is that by sharing what I\u2019ve learned from many outstanding parents, we can all resist the temptation of passive, ordinary parenting and do better.\n1. Extraordinary parents see children as blessing\nOrdinary parents see children as inconvenient little nuisances who get in the way of their preferences. When I became a father, I was an ordinary parent. Monica wanted children quickly after we got married. I wanted to enjoy each other, make money, and see the world. When we did start a family and begin to experience sleepless nights and plenty of tears, I felt justified in my prior resistance. Then, I read Psalm 127, where God says children are a blessing. In fact, if I see children as anything other than a blessing, I am missing the very heart of God. The truth of Psalm 127 allowed me to find joy in parenting and treasure the time I spend with our kids. Do you see your children as a blessing?\nPsalm 127:3-5: \"Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring a reward from him. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one\u2019s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.\"\n2. Extraordinary parents teach boundaries\nThere is fierce competition for who and what influences a child\u2019s heart \u2013 from smartphones and movies, to friends and social media. Ordinary parents are afraid of their kids getting bored and allow their children unfettered access to iPads, phones, Kindles, movies, and other media. Under the guise of \u201Cnot prying,\u201D ordinary parents let their kids date far too early in life; stay overnight with families they know very little about; and sit naively by while their child\u2019s iPad, phone, and computer become gateways to explicit content. Extraordinary parents work hard to protect what information and influences are stored in their child\u2019s heart. Extraordinary parents known that pornography addiction often begins early in childhood, and they monitor access to media and technology. Extraordinary parents have boundaries with and for their kids, and in doing so, teach their children how to protect their hearts.\nDo you teach your kids about boundaries?\nProverbs 4:23: \"Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.\"\n3. Extraordinary parents make the most of moments\nOrdinary parents outsource discipleship and spiritual instruction to their church or the school. Extraordinary parents look for teachable moments everywhere, from meal times, to drive times, to bed time. Extraordinary parents ask kids questions and listen carefully to the questions they ask. They model faithfulness and teach their kids God\u2019s plan and purpose for their lives. Extraordinary parents know that God\u2019s \u201CPlan A\u201D is for parents to pass on His values to the next generation. Extraordinary parents know that discipling their children is God\u2019s highest calling in their lives.\nDo you make the most of MOMENTS for teaching your children? Strategically focus on four times with your children \u2013¬†morning time, meal time, drive time, and evening time.\nDeuteronomy 6:5-9: \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.\"\n4. Extraordinary parents live as examples\nOrdinary parents tell kids that following Jesus and knowing God\u2019s Word are important, but their actions say that work, possessions, sports, and pleasure take priority over the Lord. Ordinary parents urge their kids to respect authority, then routinely bash their boss, government leaders, school administrators, and the police officer who issued them a ticket. Extraordinary parents understand that when children observe hypocrisy at home, it can completely turn a child off to faith. I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting many young adults whose extraordinary parents woke up early each morning to study Scripture; they had moms who left sweet notes and Bible verses in their lunch box; their fathers wrote Scripture and words of encouragement on the bathroom mirror for them to read. Those extraordinary parents know that modeling an authentic relationship with Jesus is the most important thing they could ever do as parents.\nYour actions teach children what you really think is important. The best thing you can do for your children is to have an authentic relationship with Jesus Christ.\n1 Corinthians 11:1: \"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.\"\n5. Extraordinary parents ask for forgiveness\nI interviewed some of the most extraordinary young adults I know, and one thing I heard consistently was, \u201CWhen my parents made a mistake, they asked for forgiveness.\u201D All parents make mistakes. The difference is that extraordinary parents own their mistakes and ask for forgiveness. Many ordinary parents are too prideful to recognize or admit their own failings and flaws. Some of the humblest young adults I know learned humility from parents who modeled it, regularly asked for forgiveness, and turned their mistakes into memorable, teachable moments.\nWhen is the last time you\u2019ve asked your child for forgiveness? If a month has gone by, it\u2019s probably too long.\nEphesians 6:4: \"Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.\"\n1 John 1:8: \"If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.\"\n6. Extraordinary parents discipline consistently, calmly, and with care\n\u201CThermostat parents\u201D keep their kids comfortable at all times, avoiding the inconvenience of discipline and protecting their children from consequences. When ordinary parents discipline their kids, they use the shortcuts of anger, strength, and intimidation so a child fears the parent more than the wrong choice they made. Extraordinary parents approach discipline like a referee. Referees never get upset when a player jumps offside. The Ref clearly communicates the offense, calmly explains the predetermined consequence, and enforces it every single time. As I\u2019ve ministered to young adults over the years, I\u2019m convinced of this: Extraordinary kids were disciplined prayerfully, calmly, consistently, and with care.\nHow do you discipline your children?\nProverbs 13:24: \"Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them.\"\nHebrews 12:11: \"No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.\"\n7. Extraordinary parents pray persistently\nOrdinary parents are constantly stressed out, wondering where they can turn to for help. Extraordinary parents understand that worry and prayer each require the same amount of energy. Extraordinary parents turn their concerns into prayers for wisdom and faith. Extraordinary parents know that worry is a waste of time and prayer is powerfully productive.\nDo you pray persistently for your children? Prayer is the real work of parenting.\n1 Samuel 12:23: \"Far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right.\"\nHebrews 4:16: \"Let us then approach God\u2019s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.\"\n8. Extraordinary parents become students of their children\nOrdinary parents live vicariously through their children, working to give kids the life they wanted, rather than the life God wants for their kids. Ordinary parents believe in one-size-fits-all in parenting. Extraordinary parents understand their kids\u2019 unique gifts and their children\u2019s struggles and sin patterns. Extraordinary parents are students of their children\u2019s wiring. Parenting a child well starts with a deep understanding of how God made them, and the works the Lord has prepared them for.\nAre you becoming a student of your children? Knowing their strengths, weaknesses, and struggles will help you to shepherd them as they learn to confess and repent from sin patterns and unleash their unique gifts for God\u2019s glory.\n1 Corinthians 9:22-23: \"To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.\"\nEphesians 2:10: \"For they are God\u2019s incredible creation, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\n9. Extraordinary parents understand that their presence is the greatest present\nIt\u2019s been said that rules without relationship lead to rebellion. Ordinary parents work to provide more \u201Cstuff,\u201D when what a kid needs most is more of their parents' time. If there was a parenting scoreboard, spending time with our kids is how we\u2019d earn points. Extraordinary parents know that when it comes to time with their kids, \u201Cwhere\u201D is less important than \u201Cwho.\u201D Disneyworld \u201Ccounts\u201D just as much as tee-ball practice or a bedtime story. The shot clock is ticking, and when your children graduate and leave home, there will be no more \u2018points\u2019 to score. So, make the most of every opportunity to spend time with your kids.\nDo you your kids spell love, T-I-M-E.? You cannot know your children without spending time with them.\nPsalm 90:12: \"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.\"\n10. Extraordinary parents know that only grace makes parents extraordinary\nGrace covers a multitude of parenting mistakes. Sometimes extraordinary kids come from broken homes or abusive backgrounds, and God redeems their upbringing. Sometimes great homes produce prodigals who have not returned. Obedience is not always defined by the outcome. Often, we take far too much credit when our kids do well, and too much blame when they don\u2019t.\nDo you know that only God\u2019s grace makes extraordinary parents because grace covers a multitude of parenting mistakes? Let Him continue to parent you as you parent your children.\nIsaiah 1:2: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.\"\nParenting is hard work, so don\u2019t go at it alone. Invite other trusted friends to speak into how you\u2019re doing. No matter how you have fallen short as a parent, each day is a new opportunity to own your mistakes, ask for forgiveness, and reprioritize. We can be thankful for our children, teach them boundaries, make the most of teachable moments, exemplify faithfulness, discipline with care, pray, learn, and be more available. There\u2019s an extraordinary parent in all of us.\nTrending in Opinion\nDoug Schoen: Trump shouldn\u2019t have fired Jeff Sessions \u2013 here\u2019s why\nGregg Jarrett: Trump did the right thing by telling Jeff Sessions \u2013 You\u2019re Fired!\nGutfeld on the Kavanaugh effect on midterms\nNewt Gingrich: The one big thing the liberal media never told you about Trump and the midterms\nADVERTISEMENT\nU.S.\nCrime\nMilitary\nEducation\nTerror\nImmigration\nEconomy\nPersonal Freedoms\nFox News Investigates\nWorld\nU.N.\nConflicts\nTerrorism\nDisasters\nGlobal Economy\nEnvironment\nReligion\nScandals\nOpinion\nPolitics\nExecutive\nSenate\nHouse\nJudiciary\nForeign policy\nPolls\nElections\nEntertainment\nCelebrity News\nMovies\nTV News\nMusic News\nStyle News\nEntertainment Video\nBusiness\nMarkets\nPolitics\nTechnology\nFeatures\nBusiness Leaders\nLifestyle\nFood + Drink\nCars + Trucks\nTravel + Outdoors\nHouse + Home\nFitness + Well-being\nStyle + Beauty\nFamily\nScience\nArchaeology\nAir & Space\nPlanet Earth\nWild Nature\nNatural Science\nDinosaurs\nTech\nSecurity\nInnovation\nDrones\nComputers\nVideo Games\nMilitary Tech\nHealth\nHealthy Living\nMedical Research\nMental Health\nCancer\nHeart Health\nChildren's Health\nTV\nShows\nPersonalities\nWatch Live\nFull Episodes\nShow Clips\nNews Clips\nAbout\nCareers\nCollege Students\nFox Around the World\nAdvertise With Us\nAd Choices\nMedia Relations\nCompliance\nOther\nFox Nation\nFox News Shop\nFox News Go\nFox News Radio\nFox News Insider\nNewsletters\nAlerts\nPodcasts\nApps & Products\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nGoogle+\nInstagram\nRSS\nEmail\nFox News\nNew Terms of Use\nNew Privacy Policy\nClosed Captioning Policy\nHelp\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ¬©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

Do you even remember what they were? People would say midterms. They¬† would say, 'What is that? What is it?' right? Now it's like the hottest thing.\"\nYep -- now the midterms are more like spring break for older children -- a crazed group who see nothing but evil in trump. Think \"Dems gone wild\" -- hell now they're even stripping!\n\"Vote!! Like your life depends on it. Vote!\" said Chelsea Handler on Instagram while nude.\nThat's an actual adult.\nSo exactly two years ago, these kids got their blind rage on, and never took it off. There was no pleasing them. Especially if they're well off enough not to be affected by a great economy or job market. They don't need trump the way the rest of America does. And Trump is a great target.\nHe's a law and order guy -- defending the process behind borders, national and domestic security. Its one word: boundaries. Boundaries exist to frame the path toward a goal. Wyoming without fences is just another chunk of the planet. Add fences and you get order and logic.\nYou need them for a country's identity -- and you need them as laws -- which allow people to lead free lives without harm.\nThe problem?\nAny law and order stance becomes heartless, because the left separates the process -- which is enforcing laws -- from the results, which is creating order. The military, cops, ICE -- they're just big meanies.\nIt's childish to pretend that laws don't lead to better lives. But it works.\nSo today's vote is about adults versus those with a teenage view of the world. And even though the kids know that without grown-ups, they'd be dead -- who cares? Because the adults will always be around, hurting feelings, making rules, imposing limits -- making life possible.\nKids just have a hard time forgiving grown-ups for making life possible.\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld\u2019s monologue on \u201CThe Five\u201D on November 6,¬†2018.\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM\/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM\/ET) .

Too easy.¬†But here's another example of how the left injects politics into everything.\nRemember when politics stayed in its ugly little lane?¬†Now, it's all over the place: sports, movies, your dessert.¬†That's what happens when you decide that the personal is political.\nYou can't escape it. Look at the label. Maybe it's me, but I prefer not to be glared at while eating ice cream. I get that at home without the carton.¬†But thanks to the left, keeping politics out of regular life is seen as complicit to evil. If you don't join our mad crusade, you're the problem, too.\nNow I bet it tastes good -- but who cares. The company says that by purchasing this glop you'll be supporting \"groups...who are fighting President Trump's regressive agenda.\"\nThey should add, \"while also adding to your deadly obesity.\"¬†Because isn't that what Ben & Jerry's does? They speak calories to power.\nAccording to the NIH, obesity and being overweight together leads to 300,000 deaths per year in the U.S., that's second only to smoking.\nThe math is simple: if obesity kills that many people a year, and ice cream makes you obese....how large a role does Ben & Jerry's play in this? Aren't they part of the problem? They're like overweight Marlboro men!\nMaybe that\u2019s why they play up the activism.\nThey want you to think their heart is in the right place, as they're busy clogging yours.\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld\u2019s monologue on \u201CThe Five\u201D on October 31,¬†2018.\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM\/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM\/ET) .

Then remove it when it didn't?\nIt\u2019s not about her background. It\u2019s about cheating.\nShe's a white woman of vast European ancestry, who went to the buffet of identity politics and took seconds, and thirds.\nWarren is Native American because she said so. She wins the \"2018 Rachel Dolezal award.\"\nSo - if we all do the same test, and find similar percentages, aren't we also eligible, to claim the experiences of an oppressed group, and their past grievances?\nHer results now become the standard for anyone choosing a past that offers an edge - who can now skip ahead in admissions or jobs - in places where diversity trumps experience.\nAnd so, DNA tests becomes the new affirmative action.\nBut at whose expense?\nMaybe no one.\nBecause if we're all a little oppressed, we're all good.\nGoodbye identity politics!\nIf everyone is a minority, then nobody is.\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld\u2019s monologue on \u201CThe Five\u201D on October 15, 2018.\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM\/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM\/ET) .

And if big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.\"\nNow compare that common sense to Google\u2019s virtue-signaling cowardice.\nFirst, Google suspended its contracts with our military when some workers whined about it.\nThen they help China create a search engine that censors criticisms of its leaders -- which suits Google, since they'll remove anything that upsets them.\nApparently, this tech titan thinks it more evolved than the country it exploits. Defense is so yesterday. Security is for fascists. Plus they're terrified of the activists in the company cafeteria.\nGoogle ignores their heroic predecessors -- like Ford and Douglas Aircraft -- or tech geniuses Alan Turing and Norbert Wiener. Turing, who helped invent modern computing, also broke secret codes to beat the Nazis. Mathematician, Norbert calculated rocket trajectories during the same war. Even movie stars like Hedy Lamarr helped out. She came up with a guidance system for American torpedos! Top that, Taylor Swift.\nThese people didn't care about PR. They cared about a country's survival.\nNot Google.\nThey maybe be the greatest search engine on earth, but one thing they'll never find is a spine.\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld\u2019s monologue on \u201CThe Five\u201D on October 17, 2018.\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM\/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM\/ET) .

They think that if you try hard enough, if you manage your time well enough, if you\u2019re selfless enough, prayerful enough, godly enough, you\u2019ll never disappoint anyone. I fear these people are headed for a rude awakening.\nI know this, because I was one of those people. For so many years, I was deeply invested in people knowing that I was a very competent, capable, responsible person. I needed them to know that about me, because if that was true about me, I believed, I would be safe and happy. If I was responsible and hardworking, I would be safe and happy.\nFast forward to a deeply exhausted and resentful woman, disconnected from her best friends, trying so darned hard to keep being responsible, but all at once, unable. Something snapped, and my anger outweighed my precious competence.\nSomething fundamental had to change.\nThis is what I know for sure: along the way you will disappoint someone.\nYou will not meet someone\u2019s needs or expectations. You will not be able to fulfill their request. You will leave something undone or poorly done. Possibly, this person will be angry with you, or sad. You\u2019ve left them holding the bag. Or maybe instead of sadness or anger, they\u2019ll belittle you or push all your shame buttons \u2013 maybe they\u2019ll say things like, \u201CI guess you\u2019re just not a hard worker.\u201D Or, \u201CI guess you\u2019re just a low-capacity person.\u201D Or, \u201CI thought I could count on you.\u201D These are basically sharp blades straight into the hearts of people like me, people who depend very heavily on meeting people\u2019s expectations.\nBut here\u2019s the good news: you get to decide who you\u2019re going to disappoint, who you\u2019re going to say no to. And it gets easier over time, the disappointing.\nWhat you need along the way: a sense of God\u2019s deep, unconditional love, and a strong sense of your own purpose.\nWithout those two, you\u2019ll need from people what is only God\u2019s to give, and you\u2019ll give up on your larger purpose in order to fulfill smaller purposes or other people\u2019s purposes.\nTo be sure, finding your purpose can take a long time to figure out, and along the way it is tempting to opt instead for the immediate gratification, the immediate fix, of someone\u2019s approval. But the sweet rush of approval, the pat on the head, can often derail us from real love, and real purpose.\nTime always helps me make these decisions, because if I\u2019m rushed, I always say yes. When I have time, I can instead say to myself: Go back to being loved; go back to your purpose. This thing I am being asked to do will not get me more love. And this will not help me meet my purpose.\nSome of us have trouble disappointing people in authority. Or people we want to impress, or people who seem fancy or important in some way. I\u2019ve realized one thing that makes it hard for me to disappoint people is my tendency to overestimate how close I am to someone, and then how imperative it is that I don\u2019t disappoint this dear, dear friend. But upon closer inspection, I am probably not this person\u2019s dear friend. This is probably not a deep heart wound, but probably more a small professional disappointment. Those are very different.\nAnd there\u2019s a difference between forsaking a friendship or family relationship and speaking the truth about our limitations. I\u2019m finding that many of our friendships actually grow when we\u2019re more honest about what we can and can\u2019t do.\nPeople who don\u2019t care much about what other people think of them don\u2019t generally struggle with disappointing people. Frankly, I\u2019m not there yet. I think this is harder for women than for men, and harder for moms than for other women, possibly because we\u2019re in that mode \u2013 that nose-wiping, cereal-pouring, need-meeting season of life.\nI remind myself: This will not make me feel loved, so if that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying yes, that\u2019s not a good reason. The love I want will not be found here, and what I will feel in its place is resentment and anger.\nI\u2019m committed to a particular, limited amount of things in this season, and if what\u2019s being asked of me isn\u2019t one of those, then it stands in the way. That\u2019s why knowing your purpose and priorities for a given season is so valuable \u2013 because those commitments become the litmus test for all the decisions you face.\nPicture your relationships like concentric circles: the inner circle is your spouse, your children, your very best friends. Then the next circle out is your extended family and good friends. Then people you know, but not well, colleagues, and so on, to the outer edge. Aim to disappoint the people at the center as rarely as possible. And then learn to be more and more comfortable with disappointing the people who lie at the edges of the circle \u2013 people you\u2019re not as close to, people who do not and should not require your unflagging dedication. To do this, though, you have to give even the people closest to you \u2013 maybe especially the people closest to you \u2013 realistic expectations for what you can give to them.\nWe disappoint people because we\u2019re limited. We have to accept the idea of our own limitations in order to accept the idea that we\u2019ll disappoint people.\nI have this much time. I have this much energy. I have this much relational capacity.\nAnd it does get easier. The first few times I had to say no were excruciating. But as you regularly tell the truth about what you can and can\u2019t do, who you are and who you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll be surprised at how some people will cheer you on. And, frankly, how much less you\u2019ll care when other people don\u2019t.\nWhen you say, This is what I can do; this is what I can\u2019t, you\u2019ll find so much freedom in that. You\u2019ll be free to love your work, because you\u2019re not using it as a sneaky way to be loved or approved of. You\u2019ll be free to love the things you give to people, because you\u2019re giving them freely, untangled from resentments and anger.\nMy knee-jerk answer is yes. My default setting is yes. But I\u2019m learning that time and honesty and space and prayer and writing and talking with Aaron help me see more clearly what I can and can\u2019t do, with a full heart and without resentment or hustling.\nA friend I don\u2019t know well asked for help with something recently. And all the old impulses kicked in. Of course! I\u2019m your girl! Anything for you! And then I waited and breathed and prayed and waited some more, and then I lovingly, kindly disappointed her, and I\u2019m happy to report we both survived.\nBaby steps.\nTaken from \" Present Over Perfect \" by Shuana Niequist.

And, perhaps the president\u2019s signature achievement so far, a historic tax overhaul which has put money back in the pockets of more than 80 percent of American families.\nBut this is not the time to take our foot off the gas pedal.\nAs we approach the upcoming midterm elections, we need to acknowledge the looming threats and take action so this important progress is not undone. Poll after poll shows that health care is the number one issue for voters in the midterms. A recent Fox News poll showed that 65 percent of respondents said it was their number one issue because of affordability concerns. Forty percent said it was their number one issue over concerns of a government takeover of the health care industry.\nLet's face it: ObamaCare didn\u2019t work. Plain and simple. Besides, Americans want and deserve something better.\nIt\u2019s time for Republicans to lean in on health care, not shy away from it. It should be a key message in the final weeks and days of campaigning and a central focus of Congress during the lame duck session. Republicans led boldly on tax reform. They should do the same with health care reform.\nWe can start with low-hanging fruit, like stopping harmful \u2013 and unpopular \u2013 ObamaCare taxes, like the health insurance, medical device and Cadillac taxes.\nThis is not rocket science: even Democrats conceded that the Health Insurance Tax (HIT) was a bad policy when they passed bipartisan legislation in 2015 \u2013 signed by Obama \u2013 to delay the taxes until 2017. They then delayed the tax again for 2019.\nThe Republican Party needs to make the issue of health care reform one of utmost importance to voters. Success at the polls may very well depend on it.\nWithout immediate action by Congress, this tax will return in 2020 \u2013 and if Republicans keep the House and Senate, it will be on the GOP\u2019s watch, and it will cause significant harm to businesses, seniors and families. While 2020 may feel far away, it's really not because insurers are setting 2020 premiums now.\nBut let's face it: this isn\u2019t just about repealing a part of ObamaCare. It\u2019s also about protecting the benefits of tax reform. In 2020, the average family will see $2,059 in savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But if Congress fails to do something, nearly 25 percent of the tax cut, or $500 in savings per family, will be wiped out to pay for the Health Insurance Tax.\nIf the GOP ignores this looming threat, the HIT-driven premium hikes will strike right before the 2020 elections, which could prove disastrous for Republicans and Trump. Along with tackling some of these no-brainer health care policies, Republicans should focus on ways to give states more flexibility, such as Medicaid block grants and limiting federal requirements. But they should also focus on pricing transparency and addressing one of the root causes of rising premiums and deductibles: the rising costs of procedures and care.\nWe should support health care competition and innovation, not cripple it. Promoting price transparency will empower consumers and small businesses to create purchasing pools and expand coverage without government involvement. It will unleash some of the greatest negotiators in the world, American for-profit businesses, to drive down costs for themselves and to also benefit the American people as a whole.\nWe must also support the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to tackle unsustainable drug pricing.\nNearly two years in, President Trump\u2019s scorecard is impressive. But to ensure continued progress over the remainder of his first and hopefully second terms, and to protect the president\u2019s legacy, the Republican Party needs to make the issue of health care reform one of utmost importance to voters. Success at the polls may very well depend on it.\nNed Ryun is the Founder and CEO of American Majority, a national grassroots organization.

She had a limited menu of homemade meals that consisted mostly of lasagna, baked chicken and a killer salad dressing (it substituted bacon grease for olive oil, so it really COULD be a killer). Over time she expanded her repertoire of recipes via those slim booklets you find next to the grocery store cashier, Kathy was also collecting cookbooks with easier recipes.\nOne summer day knowing we\u2019d be grilling later, I asked her to try to make potato salad. I grew up in Kansas loving my mom\u2019s version and could not wait until my new bride mastered her own.\nShe found a recipe in a cookbook and followed every instruction until she could announce proudly, \u201CIt\u2019s perfect!\u201D\n(Check out this 2018 picture of Kathy\u2019s Perfect Potato Salad, from page 72 of \u201CThe Happy Cookbook\u201D).\nShe asked me to carry the bowl of potato salad to the table, which I did as she finished prepping dinner in the kitchen. She brought out the medium-rare London broil and started to sit down, then began screaming, \u201CWhat happened to my potato salad!?!?\u201D\nActually, nothing happened to it. However, as a state fair blue-ribbon-winning chef myself, I felt that it lacked something, so I added what my mom always put on the top of her potato salad: paprika, and plenty of it, just like everybody we knew in Kansas. Clearly the cookbook she was using forgot this crucial element, so I added it as a public service.\nKathy was furious.\nIn hindsight, Mom had always made a traditional potato salad, which consisted of white potatoes, white onions, white eggs and snow-white Miracle Whip. It begged for some color, so she\u2019d add the red badge of paprika. Kathy\u2019s potato salad was like a color wheel explosion with green, orange, red and white, it didn\u2019t need anything on top \u2013¬†especially a random red.\n\u201CIt\u2026was\u2026perfect\u2026\u201D she said, her voice trailing off.¬† I knew I\u2019d hurt her feelings; she was angry that she\u2019d spent two hours making something that her husband vandalized \u2013 in four shakes from a spice jar.\nLesson learned: never screw with somebody\u2019s potato salad or anything else they\u2019ve invested time and energy into creating.¬†We all have our own ideas of what should be in a recipe, but if you want to go rogue and doctor somebody else\u2019s masterpiece, ask first \u2013 or make it yourself.\nAfter my little paprika experiment, I was worried that Kathy was still angry, and I\u2019d come home to discover she\u2019d gotten a new recipe from that movie \u2013 you know, the one where that nice lady Glenn Close shows how to cook a rabbit.\nThat\u2019s where I wake up in the dream, every time.\nThere's something about wives with knives.\nBut I will say, that I\u2019m sure if my wonderful wife Kathy served rabbit, it would be delicious\u2026if properly prepared with a dash of\u2026oh, never mind.\nAdapted from¬†\u201C The Happy Cookbook \u201D¬†by Steve Doocy and Kathy Doocy.

I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what was going on \u2013 all I knew was that the cabinets were empty.\nOn the day we ran out of food, a couple from Main Street Baptist Church in Hattiesburg, Miss., drove up to our house in a big car. We didn\u2019t know them, and we didn\u2019t go to Main Street Baptist (in fact, we weren\u2019t even Baptists).\nThey popped the trunk and began unloading bag after bag of groceries. I\u2019m pretty sure it was summertime, but it felt like Christmas, especially when I realized they had gotten us Fruit Loops.\nI sat down on the couch and began looking over the box like it was a toy. Then after they finished delivering all of the groceries, they left and we ate.\nThey popped the trunk and began unloading bag after bag of groceries. I\u2019m pretty sure it was summertime, but it felt like Christmas, especially when I realized they had gotten us Fruit Loops.\nI don\u2019t know how they found out we were in need, and it doesn\u2019t really matter to me. We needed some food, and I\u2019m just thankful that someone listened when the Lord nudged them to come through for us.\nWhen you think about it, we all have the opportunity to be¬†the answer to someone else\u2019s prayers today.¬†Maybe they don\u2019t need groceries, but they need some encouragement, a friend, an invitation, someone to listen.\nMaybe they don\u2019t even know what they need \u2013 they\u2019re just hurting and need someone like you or me to be present in their lives. Maybe we¬†will be the evidence that Jesus sees them in their hurt and that he deeply cares for them.\nSo many of us pray that God will use us in a big way. What if he wants to use us in a small way that will be big in someone\u2019s life? Is that enough? If it is, then today is full of opportunities to love Jesus with an unexpected¬†knock on the door, an open trunk and a box of Fruit Loops.\nJoshua Rogers is a writer and attorney who lives in Washington, D.C.

The Oath acknowledges and accepts the obligations of citizenship, while also granting the new Americans a range of new rights.¬†Those obligations include coming to the nation\u2019s defense in time of war, performing civilian acts of national importance when necessary, and upholding and defending the Constitution and the laws of our nation.¬†Perhaps the most beautiful thing about the obligations of citizenship is that they are not owed to some king or dictator, but to each other and now all of us \u2013 to \u201CWe the People.\u201D\nThe look of joy and elation on the faces of the newly minted Americans I met last month was a priceless reminder of so much that unites us as a nation, and what is truly good and decent about it.¬†The ceremony, and the hundreds like them that occur all around the country each year,¬†remind us that American citizenship is indeed unique. It does not rely exclusively on one\u2019s ancestry or where one was born. Anyone can be an American citizen if he or she pursues citizenship in the right way.¬†That reality has been one of our nation\u2019s great strengths over the course of our history, and the making of new American citizens is something to celebrate everywhere, every time.\nBut when immigration laws are flouted, when politicians confer the privileges of citizenship on some without demanding corresponding obligations, and when borders are erased, American citizenship is devalued.¬†Sanctuary cities, public financial aid for non-citizen college students, and drivers licenses for illegal immigrants are all examples of policies that grant the blessings of citizenship to those who do not possess it.¬†\u201CCitizenship lite\u201D attracts millions to America from across the globe \u2013 like the migrant caravan we see in motion today \u2013 who seek the peace and prosperity only America offers, but who do so in unlawful ways.\nDevaluing citizenship also undermines the confidence of Americans citizens in their government\u2019s ability to enforce its laws, as well as the government\u2019s commitment to the people it is supposed to serve.¬†And that is the heart of the immigration issue; the debate over immigration boils down to fairness.¬†American citizens who obey the law and ask only a fair shake from their government, quickly become alienated when they see public benefits handed out to those who don\u2019t do the same thing.¬†People especially don\u2019t appreciate it when politicians \u2013 elected officials asked to create laws \u2013 instead bend, break, or defy the laws of the country.\nAs the stream of migrants flows northward toward our border, and changes to our immigration laws are inevitably debated, elected officials would be wise to always keep at the center of the debate the critical importance and meaning of American citizenship.¬†Any laws passed in response to the crisis that debases the concept of citizenship will be to our peril, and laws that strengthen our sense of citizenship will be passed to our great benefit for generations of Americans to come.\nJay Webber is running for Congress in New Jersey\u2019s 11th District.

Wojtek Radwanski\/AFP\/Getty Images\nJoe Neel | NPR\n|\nNovember 21, 2017\nMore than half of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans say they have experienced violence, threats or harassment because of their sexuality or gender identity, according to new poll results being released Tuesday by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\"There are very few nationally representative polls of LGBTQ people, and even fewer that ask about LGBTQ people's personal experiences of discrimination,\" says Logan Casey, deputy director of the survey and research associate in public opinion at the Harvard Chan School. \"This report confirms the extraordinarily high levels of violence and harassment in LGBTQ people's lives.\"\nMajorities also say they have personally experienced slurs or insensitive or offensive comments or negative assumptions about their sexual orientation. And 34 percent say they or an LGBTQ friend or family member has been verbally harassed in the bathroom when entering or while using a bathroom \u2014 or has been told or asked if they were using the wrong bathroom.\nThe poll , conducted earlier this year, looked not only at violence and harassment but also at a wide range of discrimination experiences. We asked about discrimination in employment, education, in their interactions with police and the courts and in their everyday lives in their own neighborhoods. We're breaking out the results by race, ethnicity and identity. You can find what we've released so far on our series page \" You, Me and Them: Experiencing Discrimination in America .\"\nWe asked whether people see discrimination more as a one-on-one personal-prejudice issue or whether discrimination in laws or government is the larger problem.\nWe found a sizable age gap. People born after about 1967 saw the world in mostly the same way, but older LGBTQ adults much more frequently said one-on-one prejudice is the larger problem, by a wide margin.\n\"This finding highlights how life experiences and political socialization can really shape how an individual, or a generation of people, thinks about how to create change,\" Casey says. \"Older generations of LGBTQ people came of age at a time when legal protections were nearly unthinkable and activists agitated in mass scale social movements. But younger people have grown up in the era of gay marriage, 'don't ask, don't tell,' and employment protections, and more successfully petitioning for rights through judicial or legislative processes.\"\nThe survey finds a big racial gap in the LGBTQ community \u2014 LGBTQ people of color reported substantially more discrimination because they are LGBTQ than whites when applying for jobs or interacting with the police.\nLGBTQ people of color are six times more likely to say they have avoided calling the police (30 percent) owing to concern about anti-LGBTQ discrimination, compared with white LGBTQ people (5 percent).\nOur survey found significant levels of discrimination against transgender adults as well. About 1 in 6 LGBTQ people says they've been personally discriminated against because of their LGBTQ identity when going to a doctor, and nearly 1 in 5 said they've avoided seeking medical care for fear they'd be discriminated against.\n\"Research shows that experiencing discrimination has harmful effects on health,\" Casey says. \"That's an implication all the more troubling because the poll also shows the serious barriers to health care for LGBTQ and especially transgender people in America.\"\nIndeed, some 31 percent of transgender people told us they do not have regular access to a doctor or health care. We will broadcast and publish a report later Tuesday on the difficulties transgender people face in seeking health care, particularly in the face of discrimination.\nOur results also illustrate the great diversity in identities within what's called the \"LGBTQ community.\" For example, to be queer does not necessarily mean one is gay or lesbian. Nor does being transgender mean someone is necessarily gay, lesbian or bisexual. In this chart, we compare cisgender and transgender people based on their self-identified sexual orientation.\nAdditionally, our poll found that among all transgender and gender nonconforming people, 24 percent identify as transgender men, 52 percent identify as transgender women and 25 percent identify as genderqueer or gender nonconforming. More than half (56 percent) of the 86 transgender people in our survey say they are heterosexual.\nOverall, our survey found 1.4 percent of Americans identify as transgender, genderqueer and gender nonconforming. A June 2016 survey by the Williams Institute found that 0.6 percent of the adult U.S. population identifies as transgender but did not establish estimates for genderqueer or gender nonconforming adults.\nThe overall poll results for LGBTQ adults are based on a nationally representative probability-based telephone (cell and landline) sample of 489 LGBTQ adults, including people who are genderqueer and gender nonconforming. The margin of error for total LGBTQ respondents is plus or minus 6.6 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level.\nOur ongoing series \"You, Me and Them: Experiencing Discrimination in America\" is based in part on a poll\nby NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. We have previously released results for African-Americans, Latinos, whites and Native Americans.

Tony Mendoza, D-Artesia, listens at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. Mendoza has agreed pay more than $60,000 in fines to settle allegations by the Fair Political Practices Commission, that he wrongly transferred money out of a campaign committee to other Democratic state candidates and failed to disclose the transfer, Friday, Nov. 4, 2016. Rich Pedroncelli\/AP\nAP\n|\nDecember 14, 2017\nCalifornia Senate leader Kevin de Leon ramped up pressure Thursday on Sen. Tony Mendoza \u2014 his former roommate and a fellow Democrat \u2014 to take a leave of absence until an investigation into his alleged sexual misconduct ends.\nMendoza hasn't agreed.\n\"It's an ongoing conservation,\" de Leon told reporters.\nDe Leon, in the midst of a campaign against U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, made his comments during a press conference where he announced the state Senate's hiring of two law firms to handle all sexual harassment complaints made against senators and their staff for the next two years. He also promised the Senate will release within 30 days more details of which lawmakers have faced sexual harassment complaints and investigations.\nThe Senate's moves come almost two months after nearly 150 women who work in and around the Capitol released an open letter decrying a culture of pervasive sexual harassment. Two Assembly Democrats \u2014 Matt Dababneh and Raul Bocangera \u2014 have already resigned. Mendoza has maintained his seat despite allegations that he behaved inappropriately toward three young women who worked for him, including by inviting one to his Sacramento home, which he shared with de Leon. De Leon said he did not know and moved out after the accusations became public. Mendoza denies wrongdoing.\nThe outside investigation into those allegations will be completed early next year, and Mendoza should step aside in the meantime, de Leon said. The law firms will also look into allegations that Sen. Bob Hertzberg hugged female colleagues inappropriately, but de Leon said he does not think Hertzberg, known for hugging, should step aside.\nOrganizers of the mid-October letter, who now have a group called \"We Said Enough,\" criticized de Leon's actions as \"woefully inadequate\" and said the Senate should be working hand-in-hand with the Assembly rather than going at it alone.\n\"The approach does not reflect any kind of independent investigation,\" said Samantha Corbin, a lobbyist and the group's co-founder. \"An attorney hired by the Legislature is still subject to attorney-client privilege.\"\nAsked by a reporter, de Leon did not say if he would waive or narrow that attorney-client privilege to ensure transparency about the firm's investigations.\nLawyers for the firms \u2014 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Van Dermyden Maddux \u2014 said their mission is one of independent fact-finding, not protecting the Legislature. The two firms are setting up a hotline for people who have witnessed or been the subjects of harassment to report the behavior.\n\"Our job is to do a neutral investigation and the facts lead us where they lead us,\" said Deborah Maddux, the lead attorney for Van Dermyden Maddux.\nBenjamin Wagner, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California, is leading the investigation for Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Attorneys at the firm have given nearly $17,000 in campaign contributions to six Senate candidates, the Sacramento Bee reported. Wagner said neither he nor anyone on his team has donated to senators and that the firm will be impartial.\nDe Leon also announced a partnership with WEAVE, a Sacramento-based rape crisis center, to provide counseling to victims of harassment.\nThis story has been updated.\nThe best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.\nSign up to get KPCC's Short List newsletter.\nSign up\nRelated links\nTony Mendoza can't return to work yet\nCalifornia capitol sexual harassment panel says change won't be quick\nCalifornia's sexual harassment laws will expand in 2018\nIn a crisis of sexual harassment, whither the office romance?\nAfter interviewing 122 rapists, there's still one question: Why?\nCalifornia lawmaker Hertzberg faces claims his hugs were inappropriate\nCalifornia Democrats temporarily lose Assembly supermajority\nCalifornia Assemblyman Matt Dababneh resigns after bathroom sex assault claim\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nblog comments powered by Disqus\nKPCC's Politics coverage is a Southern California resource provided by member-supported public radio.

J. Scott Applewhite\/AP\nDoreen McCallister | NPR\n|\nJanuary 1, 2018\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts released his annual report on the federal judiciary on Sunday.\nIn one section of the 16-page report, he promised a careful evaluation of the judiciary's sexual misconduct policies.\nHe said recent events have \"illuminated the depth of the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace.\"\nRoberts added, \"Events in the past few weeks have made clear that the judicial branch is not immune.\"\nAs Vanessa Romo reported for The-Way last month, distinguished federal appeals court judge Alex Kozinski retired following accusations by women that he had touched them inappropriately, made lewd comments and shown them pornography.\nIn a statement released by his attorney, the 67-year-old Kozinski partially apologized for his behavior but also tried to frame parts of it as a misunderstanding.\nThe judge's career, which includes 32 years on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, appears to have been undone over 10 days, as 15 women continued to step forward with personal accounts of Kozinski allegedly making explicit remarks about them, exposing them to pornography or touching them inappropriately.\nAccounts from a combination of former female clerks and junior staffers about the abuses by Kozinski were first reported by The Washington Post . They subsequently led to a formal inquiry by the 9th Circuit \u2014 later reassigned to the 2nd Circuit . It is unclear what will happen with the investigation.\nLooking ahead, Roberts wrote in his report:\n\"The judiciary will begin 2018 by undertaking a careful evaluation of whether its standards of conduct and its procedures for investigating and correcting inappropriate behavior are adequate to ensure an exemplary workplace for every judge and every court employee.\n\"I have great confidence in the men and women who comprise our judiciary,\" Roberts wrote. \"I am sure that the overwhelming number have no tolerance for harassment and share the view that victims must have clear and immediate recourse to effective remedies.\"\nIn the year-end report, predominantly dedicated to the court system's handling of natural disasters, Roberts also highlighted the work of court employees following a year of destructive hurricanes.\n\"The hurricanes brought flooding, power outages, infrastructure damage, and individual hardship to Texas and Florida. But the judicial districts of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were especially hard hit. Judges and court employees responded in dedicated and even heroic fashion. They continued to work even in the face of personal emergencies, demonstrating their commitment to their important public responsibilities.\"\nRoberts also mentioned the historic wildfires in California and their \"smoldering consequences.\"\nCopyright 2018 NPR.

Kavanaugh testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee regarding sexual assault allegations at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill Thursday, Sept. 27, 2018. Gabriella Demczuk-Pool\/Getty Images\nKelsey Snell and Brian Naylor | NPR\n|\nOctober 5, 2018\nUpdated at 8:22 a.m.\nBrett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate on Friday, 51-49. A final vote on his confirmation is expected as soon as Saturday.\nOne Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voted with Republicans to end debate and move the nomination forward. One Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted with Democrats against ending debate.\nStill, the fate of Kavnaugh's nomination remains unclear. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted to end debate, but said she will announce her final position on whether confirm Kavanaugh Friday afternoon. Other senators could switch their votes as well.\nIn a speech leading up to the vote, Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said \"the resistance is located right here on Capitol Hill'\" and urged his colleagues to \"say no to mob rule\" by voting to confirm Kavanaugh.\nThe top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, said Republicans have \"largely chosen to ignore the testimony\" of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers.\nPresident Trump, in a tweet Friday morning , criticized what he termed \"the very rude elevator screamers,\" who he said are \"paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad!\" Without evidence, he alleged the protesters, several of whom said they have been sexual assault victims were \"paid by [financier George] Soros and others.\"\nSenators had one day to review a confidential supplemental background check into Kavanaugh's behavior in the early- to mid-1980s when he was in high school and college. The closely guarded collection of interviews is celebrated by Republican leaders as concrete proof that Kavanaugh did not harass or abuse women. Democrats say the interviews, which they originally requested, are incomplete and inconclusive.\nThe FBI report has done little to alleviate a bitter partisan fight over Kavanaugh's nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says the Senate will proceed anyway on a Friday procedural vote that could pave the way for a final confirmation vote on Saturday.\n\"What we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh,\" McConnell said at a news conference on Thursday. \"The second thing we know for sure is that there's no way anything we did would satisfy the Democrats.\"\nKavanaugh took an unusual step to boost his nomination Thursday evening, writing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal expressing regret for the heated tone of his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, including comments decrying Democratic attacks, that was seen by some wavering senators as too partisan.\n\"I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said,\" Kavanaugh wrote .\nThe White House defended Kavanaugh's demeanor during the hearings.\n\"Any human being who has been falsely accused of a range of things including gang rape has a right to be upset, has a right to be angry, and that's what we saw last week,\" said White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec during an interview with Morning Edition .\nMcConnell received the 51 votes needed to clear the procedural hurdle on Friday. Republicans have enough votes to assure Kavanaugh's nomination on their own, but only if they win the support of Collins as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who withheld judgment while the FBI completed its work.\nAll three spent hours in a secure room in the basement of the Capitol on Thursday reviewing the roughly 45 pages of FBI interviews. Collins and Flake both say the investigation was thorough, but neither would say if they are now prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh.\nFlake forced Republicans to launch the additional investigation last week after a tense negotiation with Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats. Flake spent a large portion of the afternoon reviewing the FBI work and said he saw no new evidence to corroborate any of the claims against Kavanaugh, which Flake had previously indicated would mean he will vote to confirm.\nDemocrats saw something very different in the report. Several criticized Republicans for limiting the FBI investigation to just nine interviews. They said the process ignored many potential witnesses, including Ford.\nThe FBI also apparently did not interview Kavanaugh.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said those issues raised serious doubts about Kavanaugh and his qualifications.\n\"Judge Kavanaugh stated at his hearing that the individuals at the incident involving Dr. Ford refuted her version of events,\" Schumer said Thursday. \"From their own public statements, we knew that to be false, and nothing in this report changes that.\"\nSimilar concerns moved Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., to announce Thursday that she would oppose Kavanaugh. Heitkamp is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot in November and has seen her poll numbers slip in recent weeks. She's running for re-election in a state president Trump won in 2016 by more than 35 points.\nHeitkamp said she was troubled by Kavanaugh's aggressive appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the message his confirmation would send to women and girls across the country.\n\"When considering a lifetime appointment to Supreme Court, we must evaluate the totality of the circumstances and record before us,\" Heitkamp said in a statement. \"In addition to the concerns about his past conduct, last Thursday's hearing called into question Judge Kavanaugh's current temperament, honesty, and impartiality.\"\nHer opposition leaves Manchin, as the only publicly undecided Democrat on final passage. He is also in a tough re-election campaign and was silent on Kavanaugh in the days leading up to the vote.\nThe nomination now hangs on the decisions of Collins, Murkowski, Flake and Manchin.\nCopyright 2018 NPR.

Susan Collins, R-Maine, talks on a phone while walking to a room on Capitol Hill to read the report on the supplemental FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds\/AFP\/Getty Images\nDomenico Montanaro | NPR\n|\nOctober 5, 2018\nUpdated 4:26 p.m. ET Friday\nAfter Susan Collins of Maine came out in favor of confirming him Friday afternoon on the Senate floor, Brett Kavanaugh is all but certainly headed for the Supreme Court in very short order.\nThe Senate advanced Kavanaugh's nomination , 51 to 49, Friday. A final vote is expected Saturday.\nThere was a lot that went down Friday. What exactly happened and what does it mean going forward?\nLet's explain.\nWhat did Collins say?\nThe political world was waiting for what Collins would say. After voting in favor of advancing Kavanaugh's nomination, Collins said she would announce later Friday afternoon how she would vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation.\nFrom the Senate floor, after praising Kavanaugh's judicial record and criticizing left-wing groups that opposed Kavanaugh, Collins said she believed Christine Blasey Ford was the victim of sexual assault, but that the facts presented do not mean Ford was assaulted that night or by Kavanaugh.\n\"I found her testimony to be sincere, painful and compelling,\" Collins said. \"Nevertheless, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the assault occurred.\"\nShe added, \"The allegations failed to meet the 'more likely than not' standard\" and, \"Therefore, I do not believe these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court.\"\nShe then praised the MeToo movement, saying it is \"real,\" that \"it matters\" and \"is long overdue.\" Collins also intimated that Ford may have been used by \"people who wanted to engineer\" Kavanaugh's defeat and \"cared little about her well being.\"\nWhat does this mean for other votes?\nShortly after Collins' speech ended, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, who is up for reelection this year, also announced he is voting yes.\n\"I have reservations about this vote given the serious accusations against Judge Kavanaugh and the temperament he displayed in the hearing,\" Manchin said in a statement. \"And my heart goes out to anyone who has experienced any type of sexual assault in their life. However, based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him. I do hope that Judge Kavanaugh will not allow the partisan nature this process took to follow him onto the court.\"\nManchin voted in favor of advancing Kavanaugh's nomination earlier in the day, but it was unclear how he would vote on final confirmation. It would have been quite the drama if Collins had announced a no vote, and Manchin would have been the deciding vote on whether Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court.\nInstead, Collins gave Manchin a degree of political cover.\nLisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against advancing Kavanaugh's nomination advancing to a final vote. That indicates she's unlikely to change her vote, because voting no on cloture for someone nominated by the president of your own party is a bold move. It signals she has real concerns that have not been allayed. It's hard to see how that happens in the next 24 hours when the FBI investigation is already wrapped up.\nSen. Jeff Flake, another thought-to-be-wavering senator, also voted to advance the nomination and told reporters after the vote that he expects to be a yes on final confirmation.\n\"I would think so,\" Flake said. He noted, \"Unless something big changes, I don't see what would. But anyway I'm glad we had a better process. We needed a better process.\"\nWhat happens now?\nA final confirmation vote is expected Saturday.\nIt remains to be seen how other red-state Democrats will vote now that Collins and Manchin have all but guaranteed Kavanaugh's confirmation to the court.\nThere are 10 Democrats running for reelection in states President Trump won in 2016, and the Kavanaugh confirmation battle has fired up the GOP base.\nDemocrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana announced their opposition to Kavanaugh Sept. 28, a day after the gut-wrenching testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh.\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, perhaps the most vulnerable senator up for reelection, also announced that she's voting no.\nDo any of those \u2014 or other \u2014 votes change?\nWhat could it mean for the midterms?\nAll year, Democrats have dominated on who is more fired up for these midterm elections. But an NPR\/PBS NewsHour\/Marist poll found Republican enthusiasm on the rise since the dueling Kavanaugh, Ford testimonies.\nDemocratic enthusiasm is still high, but the gap closed significantly to a statistical tie.\nDoes that last? Kavanaugh being confirmed will keep Democrats fired up, but was it a short-term bump for Republicans or does it recede?\nIf Friday wasn't the vote to confirm Kavanaugh, what was it?\nFriday's vote was on what's known as cloture. That's whether to end, or close, debate. For this vote, that was to end debate on Kavanaugh's nomination and advance it to a final vote.\nThink of it this way: Don't you ever have those moments when someone just won't stop talking, and you want to say, \"Enough already\"? When they won't stop talking in the Senate, that's called a filibuster. And to cut them off in the Senate, you need 60 votes to do it.\nBut not for Supreme Court nominations anymore.\nWhy doesn't the Senate require 60 votes anymore to confirm a Supreme Court nominee?\nDemocratic Leader Harry Reid, when he was majority leader in 2013 , grew frustrated by Republicans' record use of the filibuster.\nSen. Mitch McConnell, then minority leader, hatched a plan to thwart President Barack Obama from remaking the federal judiciary by aligning Republicans against Obama's nominees in lockstep. That made it impossible to get 60 votes, thereby making it impossible for Obama to get anyone through.\nIn response, Reid threatened to change the rules and get rid of the 60-vote requirement for lower court nominees. McConnell persisted, and Reid changed the rules. McConnell then warned that he would up the ante and blow up the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, and when he got in power, he did just that last year during the confirmation process for Neil Gorsuch .\nThat leaves us where we are now with an acrimonious and pitched political battle, roughly along party lines, to vote through a Supreme Court nominee.\nOK, so the vote Friday was 51-49. Who voted and how?\nThe key quartet everyone has been watching are Republicans Flake, Collins, Murkowski and Democrat Manchin.\nThree of the four voted for cloture to advance Kavanaugh \u2014 Flake, Collins and, surprisingly to some, Manchin.\nThat was enough for a majority.\nIf Manchin had voted no, would that have sunk Kavanaugh?\nNo, because that would make it a 50-50 tie, and Vice President Pence would be called in to break the tie in his titular role as president of the Senate.\nWhy would Manchin vote yes?\nHe's is up for re-election in a very red state, West Virginia. Trump won West Virginia by more than 40 points. Manchin is favored to win re-election, but the Kavanaugh confirmation battle has fired up what was seen as a dormant Republican base.\nManchin is trying to tread carefully and not jeopardize his chances.\nDo the senators have to vote the same way on a final vote?\nNo. There's nothing stopping any one of them from changing their vote. It's a completely new vote. It is rare for someone to change a vote from one step to another, but it's not unheard of.\nSome senators are fine with advancing a nomination or bill to be voted on, but not OK with the nominee or the substance of legislation.\nIn fact, last year, Collins voted yes in committee on Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, but then voted against her in the final vote. Her reason: DeVos wasn't strong enough on public education.\nA committee vote is not exactly the same as ending cloture, but it's a decent corollary as a two-step process.\nWhy might a senator change his or her vote from one step to another?\nSome senators object to the increased use of the filibuster and might want to uphold what they call \"regular order.\" The late-Sen. John McCain, for example, voted in favor of advancing the GOP's Affordable Care Act repeal legislation to the Senate floor and then dramatically voted no on final passage.\nSome might want to thread a political needle, especially when they're in the majority, but in a state that leans the opposite way from their party.\nFor example, say you are a Republican, from a left-leaning state like Maine. You might not want to appear to be siding with Democrats in trying to outright block a nominee but want to wait to announce your final vote.\nBut that is not what happened with Collins.\nCopyright 2018 NPR.

In just three weeks, YouTube helped him improve his math skills from a 10th grade level to the level required to take physics classes at New River Community College in Virginia. Today, he makes a living as a physicist, using Bernoulli differential equations in fluid flow systems. Joshua is not alone--people all over the world use YouTube to learn and follow their passions.\nWhether it\u2019s learning prerequisites for a college course or how to compete in Olympic javelin throwing , everyone seems to have turned to YouTube to learn something. Many of these learning stories are powered by an incredible community of EduTubers like PhysicsGirl and Manual do Mundo , whose videos have demonstrated the appeal of content that enriches as well as entertains.\nIn July, Susan, our CEO, announced YouTube Learning, an initiative to support all those who use YouTube to share their knowledge with the world and the millions of users who come to our platform to learn. And today she shared that we\u2019ll be investing $20m to expand this initiative as we strive to make YouTube even better for educators and learners. Here\u2019s more on the steps we\u2019ll be taking:\nFunding for Great Educational Creators on YouTube\nHigh quality learning content is time-consuming to research, produce, and edit. That\u2019s why we\u2019re announcing a new Learning Fund to support creators who make some of the best learning content on YouTube. This includes videos covering a wide range of topics from career skills, like interviewing and resume building, to computer science, like coding for game development and JavaScript basics.\nWe\u2019ve already completed our first round of investment in some of the most respected names in online education like TED-Ed or Hank and John Green\u2019s Crash Course . We\u2019re also supporting many of our emerging EduTubers like Socratica and Linda Raynier . Creators who are interested in applying to the Learning Fund can sign up for more information here .\nIn addition to investing in EduTubers through the Learning Fund, we\u2019re also developing new YouTube Originals focused on learning like Mind Field: Season 3 from Vsauce creator Michael Stevens, and a new series with Vox Entertainment which was announced earlier this month.\nPartnering with Trusted Institutions\nWe know it\u2019s important to make quality learning content easier to find on YouTube, so we\u2019re launching a new channel called Learning , where major partners like Goodwill and Year Up are contributing curated playlists highlighting videos that teach career skills. The channel will make it easy for users to find tutorials, DIY videos, explainers, and skill-based playlists.\nWe\u2019re also excited to announce partnerships with leading online learning platforms, like edX , a non-profit offering courses from the world\u2019s best universities and institutions, and OpenClassrooms , an education platform based in France. Together they will bring over some of their most popular video courses to YouTube.\nExpanded Resources and Support for EduTubers\nIn 2018 we\u2019ve held YouTube EduCon conferences in California, Mexico, and Brazil to connect EduTubers with new resources and each other. These creators are a testament that powerful educational content can come from anyone, anywhere. Here are a few more ways we plan to support them in 2019:\nExpanding YouTube EduCon to Europe and Asia, starting with India in December and the UK in February.\nProviding more resources to aspiring EduTubers like our Creator Academy course for educational channels, and our new Learning Best Practices .\nHosting a NextUp creator camp specifically for emerging EduTubers.\nWorking to connect EduTubers with brand partners through FameBit. We have already secured investments for sponsored content specifically for the EduTuber community.\nWe may not all become scientists or professional chefs by learning through videos, but we can promise that anyone who wants to learn and teach will have ever greater opportunities to do so on YouTube. Expect more announcements in the months and years to come as we continue to meet with you and hear how we can best support learning on YouTube.\nMalik Ducard, Global Head of Learning, Social Impact, Family, Film & TV, recently viewed \" Where Does the #Hashtag Symbol Come From? \"\nGoogle\nLabels:\n#YouTubeLearning\nYouTube makes it simple for fans to experience live performances with Eventbrite\nThursday, October 18, 2018\nOver 1 billion fans come to YouTube each month to connect with their favorite artists and discover new music. Thanks to a new partnership with Eventbrite, we\u2019re making it simple for fans to go from experiencing music online to seeing live performances. Starting today, fans watching videos from YouTube Official Artist Channels will see Eventbrite listings for live music performances throughout the U.S. below the video. With one easy click on the \u201CTickets\u201D button, they\u2019ll be able to purchase directly from Eventbrite. Live events continue to be a major source of revenue for artists, so we want to help artists keep fans updated on their upcoming shows and sell more tickets to live performances. YouTube\u2019s global audience also lets artists find new fans with 26% of Millenials (44% of teens) claiming they discover live music events on YouTube, according to Nielsen. Through our partnerships with Eventbrite and Ticketmaster , YouTube now covers more than 70% of the US ticketing market and we\u2019ll continue to add new artists and venues of all sizes to our list in North America as well as expand globally. We're excited to further the power of video discovery on YouTube to bring artists and fans together and continue supporting those connections through live shows.\nThe YouTube Music Team\nGoogle\nCelebrating great teachers on YouTube\nFriday, October 5, 2018\nA great teacher can unleash a student\u2019s curiosity and change the direction of their life.
