A pumpkin is a <strong>cultivar of a squash plant</strong>, most commonly of Cucurbita pepo, that is round, with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and deep yellow to <i>orange coloration</i>. The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. Some exceptionally large cultivars of squash with similar <em>appearance have also been</em> derived from Cucurbita maxima.

<p> Waxy corn (maize) was found in China in 1909. As this plant showed many peculiar traits, the American breeders long used it as a genetic marker to tag the existence of hidden genes in other maize breeding programs. In 1922 a researcher found that the endosperm of waxy maize contained only amylopectin and no amylose starch molecule in opposition to normal dent maize varieties that contain both. Until World War II, the main source of starch in the USA was tapioca but when Japan severed the supply lines of the States, they forced processors to turn to waxy maize. Amylopectin or waxy starch is now used mainly in food products, but also in the textile, adhesive, corrugating and paper industry.
