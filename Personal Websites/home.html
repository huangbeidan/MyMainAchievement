        I just love programming and couldn't let it go. So I've decided to pursue another degree for master of computer science. It's a huge decision for me, especially for a girl who has never been exposed to software engineering environment until last year. But I believe that with my passion and some talent, I could make a difference!

      <div class="desc">
        My first time in United States. Also my code journey starts here. I started using computer programming software to solve some financial and real-life problems, such as using NLP to do stock slection and back-testing. During my internship at Sherpherd Ventures, I also invented codes to do basic technical analysis.

        Not surprisingly, I studied economics for my undergraduate, not technical at all. But thanks to it, I have a richful life for the four years, attending a lot of social events, doing a bunch of presentations, and developing a good sense of "business". In 2015, I was even awarded with full scholarship to study in Australia.
